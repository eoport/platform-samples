This sample projects demonstrates how to use the EOPORT API.

The EOPORT API documentation is available @ https://webapp.dev02.eoport.eu/docs/index.html in OpenAPI v3 format and @ https://webapp.dev02.eoport.eu/docs/apidocs/index.html for its HTML format and supporting libraries.

The sample project performs a login and then a few typical API calls. To be able to run the project you will need to have signed up to EOPORT as a customer and request the client id and secret to our support staff @ support@eoport.com
