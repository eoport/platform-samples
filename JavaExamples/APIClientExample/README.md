This sample projects demonstrates how to use the EOPORT API. It is written in Java and generates the API code directly from the Open API v3 yaml file.

The EOPORT API documentation is available @ https://webapp.dev02.eoport.eu/docs/index.html in OpenAPI v3 format and @ https://webapp.dev02.eoport.eu/docs/apidocs/index.html for its HTML format and supporting libraries.

The sample project performs a login and then a few typical API calls. To be able to run the project you will need to have signed up to EOPORT as a customer and request the client id and secret to our support staff @ support@eoport.com
