# platform-samples
This is a public repository for EOPORT platform samples.

The samples illustrate the different integrations with the EO PORT platform. Some samples are coded in Java and others in Python.

The different use cases are:
- EOPORT API usage, available under JavaExamples/APIClientExample. This example illustrates how to authenticate and how to call the EOPORT API. You will need to have signed up to EOPORT and have your user credentials available. You will also need to request the API key and secret. Please contact us @ support@eoport.com for the later and any other technical or commercial support.
- EOPORT subscription callback integration, available under PythonExamples/subscription_callback. When you create a subscription via the web app or via the API you can specify a callback URL. This example illustrates in very simple terms how to receive the subscription notification and how to read it.
- EOPORT service integration. If you are a service provider and wish to register one or more services within the EOPORT platform, you will need to register your service in EOPORT and write the code to interface with the associated workflow. This sample creates a dummy sample service and shows how to interface with the service orchestration. To find out more about becoming a service provider please contact us @ support@eoport.com.
